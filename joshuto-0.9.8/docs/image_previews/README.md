# Image Thumbnails in File Previews

Joshuto supports some terminal graphics protocols for image previews directly.
See [ratatui-image](https://github.com/benjajaja/ratatui-image?tab=readme-ov-file#compatibility-matrix)
for which terminals are supported.

To disable or override the detected protocol, the `preview_protocol` option can
be used in the `joshuto.toml` file. Accepted values are `auto` (default), 
`disabled`, or any of the [implemented protocols](https://docs.rs/ratatui-image/latest/ratatui_image/picker/enum.ProtocolType.html) 
in lowercase.
```toml
[preview]
preview_protocol = "halfblocks"
...
```

However, since not all terminals have some graphics protocol implementation, 
Joshuto offers two text-preview-related hooks which allow to easily implement
an image preview with some simple scripts.
The hooks can be configured in the `joshuto.toml` file.
```toml
[preview]
...
preview_script = "~/path/to/some/executable_script_1"
preview_shown_hook_script = "~/path/to/some/executable_script_2"
preview_removed_hook_script = "~/path/to/some/executable_script_3"
```
The `preview_script` hook is called the first time for textual previews (thus
it's cached). If the script returns zero, then its output is displayed.

The `preview_shown_hook_script` is called each time a file-preview (in the 3rd 
pane) is focused.

The `preview_removed_hook_script` will be called each time the file preview 
panel completely disappears in Joshuto.
That is the case if the user selects a file for which no file preview is shown
(either due to missing output of the preview script or due to file size),
if the preview is not cached already and the preview pane is temporarily removed,
or if the selection jumps from a file to a directory.

The ‚Äúshown‚Äù script gets the path of the file being previewed
as first argument and then the x and y coordinate and the width a
height of the preview area as second to fifth parameters.

The ‚Äúremoved‚Äù script does not get any arguments.

> ‚ùó **Important: *Text* preview area is what triggers the hook scripts** ‚ùó

Using these hooks, one can trigger various actions when moving the cursor along files in Joshuto,
and they can also be used to show image previews by the help of other 3rd party tools.

# Wrapper Script
For some of the 3rd party tools, it's necessary 
to run them as a separate process, in parallel to Joshuto.

One famous example is ‚Äú√úberzug‚Äù. To be able to use such a solution,
one needs to have a ‚Äúwrapper-script‚Äù which must be started instead of Joshuto.
The wrapper-script will then start both, first the program for showing images
in the terminal and then Joshuto.
